    <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">The primary technique used to monitor coasts for vulnerability assessments is spatial data with Geographic Information System (GIS). The method for gathering spatial GIS data is satellite imagery; this is due to its relative accessibility, economic affordability, and regular repetitive coverage. GIS-based spatial data is used in a number of different analytical methodologies, which include ‘Decision Support Systems’ (DSS) and index based techniques. DSS approaches include ‘Community Vulnerability Assessment Tool’ (CVAT), DINAS-coast, Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA), Digital Shoreline Assessment System (DSAS) and vulnerability assessment [4]. Index-based techniques such as the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) are also used widely across the world [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,28] ‘Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs’ (InVEST) is an open source software model that has a wide range of models to analyze a range of coastal vulnerabilities, including social, geographical, biological and economic factors [27]. Indian coasts have been studied mostly through the use of CVI methods for physical assessments [51,52,53,54] most of these studies required a certain amount of field data for the evaluation, due to limitations in the available spatial and temporal satellite data resolution [55] Remote-sensing approaches evident in the existing literature range from air-born to space-borne data gathering techniques; however, coastal vulnerability studies along the Indian coast were mostly restricted to the use of earth observing space-borne sensors [56,57,58,59,60,61,62]. Table 1 illustrates the range of parameters used across India to evaluate coastal vulnerability in diverse circumstances.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">Coastal environments are particularly vulnerable to the effects of disasters; partly due to denser urbanization and human populations and related economic activities such as agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, industries, trades and transportation in these locations [1,2,3,4,5]. Coastal areas tend to be relatively highly urbanized with higher concentrations of human populations [6,7]. Approximately 40% of the global human population lives within 60 km of the coast [8] and more than 25% of the human population in India lies within 50 km of the coast [9]. Natural processes, particularly those affected by climate change, combined with human activities, are becoming significant factors for coastal vulnerabilities. Risks at coastal regions in India are rapidly increasing; major threats for vulnerability are mean sea level rise, extreme events like flash floods, and cyclone induced storm surges [10,11,12,13]. Increased green-house gas emissions, predominantly from human activities, are predicted to expedite climate change and sea level rises that are already making coastal zones vulnerable in the 21st century [14,15,16,17,18]. Warming oceans lead to sea level rises, which in turn provide a source of thermal expansion of sea water, contributing further to intensified and more frequent cyclone-induced storm surges [19,20,21,22] addressed the potential climate change impacts owing to drought, floods and cyclone events with more intensity and asserted that India has very high risk levels (class 9 among risk class 0–10). As a result of the changes related to climate change, there are significant challenges for assessing coastal vulnerability and subsequent adaptation and mitigation strategies [23,24]. Systematic coastal vulnerability assessments [25,26,27,28] are essential for managing coastal threats. According to Indian Coastal Zone (CRZ) regulations, the buffer zones, also known as active zones, usually cover a region of 500 m from the shoreline; these zones are more usually focused on coastal vulnerability studies.</p>
